debugging with Matt:

helpful with hex and binary commands

the servotest and the maestro controller both work
the script was running alright but wasn't commented out yet

Now try to get basic line following working, and work on really doing
more mobile robotics stuff, as well as CV stuff.
	Camera working

Also get the joystick to work in the correct direction
	Done

meet with cheever either this week or next to make new circuit
	Sent email
	1pm meeting today
	
Install ROS
	ROS Kinetic on ARM processor: wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/Ubuntu
	(Only package not installed was ros-kinetic-roslz)
	Stepping through tutorials now

Space problem?
	156 992 opencv
	99 816 opencv-contib
	5 756 DOcuments
	600 Downloads
	77 336 opencv.zip
	53 896 opencv_contrib.zip

	487 328 /home/odroid

	* can I delete the .zip files?
	* sudo apt-get clean helps free some space of Ubuntu downloads
	* sudo apt-get remove <thing to remove>

git commands:
	The odroid is synced to noah's and my repos, so follwing commands for pull/push
	david's origin is 'myorigin'
	git pull myorigin master
	git push myorigin
	everything else is the same

	On hermes, still can use with normal git add / git pull techniques


-------------------------------------------------------


Make a node that accepts commands (throttle and steering)
	Listens to command of steering angle and throttle from controller
	Essentially will redo the project_server client, and network_controller except with Nodes in ROS all on the Odroid

One node controlling car, another node listening to joystick and publishing the axis info

Maker another node that (on same comuter)

Change password for odroid

play with camera, line detecetion and line following
Joystick working with ROS
	Python node to listen to joystick throttle and steering commands and sends along to motors
