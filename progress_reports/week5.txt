dmesg – what goes on with hardware

grep – searches for text in files

TODO:
-	debug RPi and maestro servo controller
-	servotest.py script and sqURE WAVES
-	make state transition diagram, print out when changes states, and why
-	order USB block and cables with cassy

for next week: 
-	try to get as far as possible

Cheever meeting
-	Loose wire is irrelevant (b/c power already supplied to moto by LiPo batteries)
-	PWM is inverted from the mini-maestro b/c motor reads the signal inverted
-	PWM actually runs the motor by width of the modulation
o	The signal changes period as the vehicle is moved fwd and backwWrds
o	Servo controller runs the servos, but not thru PWM signal
-	When odroid move is complete, have a better way to invert the signal (put onto PCB board or some sort with Prof. Cheever later)
-	Signal inversion will be necessary with the servo controller via USB
