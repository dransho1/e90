4/2
Something is up with the camera. I got the car working following lines on the
ground, but a few issues emerged when I was SSH'ing
- camera would fail out and stop working, stop reading blobs all of the sudden
- very slow when using the colorpicker for the blobfinder
- killswitch doesn't always work in the script. will kill the car, but script
will still run after
- Camera must be mounted higher to see all the blobs correctly.
- when camera dropped, had to find colors again
- search state still doesn't work that well
- camera calibration file also missing

4/3 meeting with matt

Do everything on the motion computer
Don't name your car Otto - been done before
Following the Tmux tutorial

pkill -f ros kills all the scripts on running ros

run the blobfinder and color picker from motion
also rviz too

scp datafile.data odroid@192...:~/catkin_ws/src/destination--> secure copy protocol

4/4 work

Got line following to work (was overthinking it)
Have a plan for the month:
     Mapping the room
     Path following (using CV Hough lines)
     Object Avoidance
     Some kind of localization

Can I map the room without a turtlebot?
Camera doesn't work with cv2?
-----------------------------------------

Do laserscan obstacle avoidance and vision path following

4/5
Mounted camera
	- for some reason depth cloud is really warped
Also the cv_bridge isnt working
