3/20 - mid semester presentation saved on gdrive

Problems:

can listen to one another :)
issue when try to write to servo controller
	publishes steering on 20 second delay when line writing to the controller is active:
		self.controller.setAngle(0, steering)
	Writing to the actual controller
issue when writing to setPosition script:
	"int() argument must be a string or a number, not 'String'"
	"float" vs "Float64"
	Types converted between python and ROS std_msgs
got rid of issue when the pygame module prints debugging messages to the console
	Commented out the stuff in C, and compiled it from source

3/22
For next week:
