4/14 group meeting with Evan/Molly, Chris/Mike
No nice camera :(
Use image segmentation instead by-hand path detection
Color: hue, saturation, value (HSV)
Take many images, mark by hand, train SVM to detect the correct path in image

4/16
Gathered data ~ 19 images

4/18
Met and made script to train image and predict on it
Very slow when running polynomial
So much data >70,000 for 1 image
   Downscaling helps though
Need to pre-process image to flatten RGB one out
How to build together all iamges?

----------------------------------

4/19 Meeting with Matt
Some wizardry--> got the SVM to work with all 19 images, custom poly fit,
and random sampling of image data
TODO: 1 week and 1/2 until presentations
- Slalom
- Outside path detection in real time
- Write paper report
Email matt about slaloming later today

total TODO:
CS lab due Friday
Control exam Friday
15 pg paper due Tuesday
E90 report due Friday
E90 presentation next Monday 11:30am
