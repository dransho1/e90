Week6 notes
2/22/2017

Pi Ethernet connection: 130.58.84.218
Odroid wifi: 192.168.1.104

Does the vendor name show up when plugged in on dmesg?
Is cdc_acm module listed in lsmod on odroid?
Udev rules

Pi is loading kernel module in response to Maetro plugged in
	Software or loading problem?

*install special linux drivers to get maestro working?


Maestro controller works on odroid (after installing in libusb-1.0 and mono)
Maestro command line also works on hermes, which moves servo
-	must be the serial connection between the pieces

serial settings: (Command port = ttyACM0), (TTL port = ttyACM1)
-	which one to use?
-	usbPort = '/dev/ttyACM0  → command port!

Definitely a serial setting problem

The online version of the maestro controller works!!
-	problem with noahs?

Noah’s thing works fine tho!!!
-	***issue with sending controls from the PS3 controller to the odroid, and processing to move the servos

Matt fixed this with running the project_server.py script and uncommenting the driver part of the code!!!
