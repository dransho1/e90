Autonomous travel
- Have path, get input, run feed-forward control, correct w/positioning system (predefinded)
- Slwo crawling is best
calculating path to optimal apex, given a couple boundaries
*Probably will hit things --> mount camera to allow some bounce

* predefined map and path so no need for visual aids

vision based controls: predefined landmarks
	- pre-map, and follow beacons (colored)

Do Cone Beaconing first!
- using hte accelerometer

Either follow the cone and avoid obstacles, or travel in real-world camera interpretation of paths
