Week 9 notes
3/15/2017

Make a node that accepts commands (throttle and steering)
	Listens to command of steering angle and throttle from controller
	Essentially will redo the project_server client, and network_controller except with Nodes in ROS all on the Odroid

	* Multiple pieces of data, feed into different topics

ROS wasn’t fully installed, so just added ROS-base fixed roscore/node/topic stuff

TODO:

Get scripts all on the odroid
	Trying, but really buggy, slows down when multiple nodes/terminals running
	Getting data from joystick →  new node!
	Problem with controller and sending data to car

SSH’ing into the thing is buggy
	Pygame isn’t game for this. Pygame.event.push() kicks out when ‘visualization not set up’ weird error

•	Fixed pygame to stop printing out SDX_GetAxis bullshit messages, still works ☺
•	Also made the node just a function instead of a class because it’s way easier
