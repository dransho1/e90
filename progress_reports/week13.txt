TODO:
Laserscan data processing and avoidance
path following

-- CMake isn't working right now
-- and the laserscan is really really warped

4/9
LaserScan working
	Other than potneitally missing objects below the scan
Implemented in the line_follower (not tested)
	Simple implementation changes state to avoid, cuts off motor
	Could make more dynamic mimicing turtlebot bumper
	      Using the angle of the ray to tell where need to avoid
	      Using ray angles to where to go as well
