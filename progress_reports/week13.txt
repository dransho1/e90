TODO:
Laserscan data processing and avoidance
path following

-- CMake isn't working right now
-- and the laserscan is really really warped

4/9
LaserScan working
	Other than potneitally missing objects below the scan
Implemented in the line_follower (not tested)
	Simple implementation changes state to avoid, cuts off motor
	Could make more dynamic mimicing turtlebot bumper
	      Using the angle of the ray to tell where need to avoid
	      Using ray angles to where to go as well
4/11
Test Odroid
LaserScan avoidance works
Trying to re-direct robot in correct direction
       Need to go in opposite direction of object
       Also stay within boundaries of the road
       And quit out if find the path again and nothing blocking Odroid
LaserScan report index increasing from right to left
	  28 to -28 degrees L to R (left has a positive angle)
	  PrimeSense 1.09 specs = 57.5 degrees of view
	  zero in the middle of view,
	  Controller has 90 as steer neutral, 180 to 0 L to R (left is 180)
	  angle * 3 + 90 will work to convert
	 
4/12 meeting with Matt
TODO:
Reserach papers on roadway lane detection
	Maybe orange spray paint on the sides of paths
CV methods used for lane markings

Draft report is due Friday
Outline with some images/documentation fo what I've done

Navigation meeting on Friday
	Come prepared with ways to do this/ideas
